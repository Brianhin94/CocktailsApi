## MY LITTLE COCKTAIL BOOK

#### Technology used
* Express
* Axios
* JS,Html,Css
* ejs-layouts
* Cocktail DB api


#### Sprint Plan
I am hoping that I can first have the random cocktail database showing on screen even if in text format by the weekend. 
From there I want to work on having atleast a few of my views for different results. I see myself needing a lot of help with this especially for MVP

#### MVP goals for this project are as follows.
* Allow users to search a spirit/cocktail database
* Allow users to be shown a random cocktail
* Allow users to remove a cocktail theyre shown from the list of cocktail search matches
* Allow users to favorite cocktails


#### Stretch goals
* Formating my page to appear as a book even if it refreshes the whole page with each user action
* Adding the ability for users to search by multiple forms such as spirit: glass: ingredient to return specific cocktails
* Adding enough css to satisfy my vision.
